As an Analyst/Python AI Engineer, I helped create multiple AI tools and end-to-end solutions that improved reliability and efficiency. I built a custom vector database using MongoDB, developed a RAG system without vector storage, and implemented semantic search pipelines. I also created custom medical-domain guardrails through focused prompt engineering. Additionally, I was responsible for building FastAPI interfaces and managing data flow for each AI solution. My contributions reduced hallucinations, improved accuracy, and cut token usage for XML documents by 70%, delivering major cost savings. Using Python, FastAPI, and internal LLM tools, I enabled more consistent, scalable, and context-rich chatbot experiences.
